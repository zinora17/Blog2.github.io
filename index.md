### Description
In the monday's class, Mr.Peter was the teacher who taught in my class. During the class he give student a lot of activities. After some short part of teaching about how to paraphase, he started to give student the First activity to practise paraphase a paragraph. 

### Evaluation and analyze
The biggest difference between Mr.Peter and Mr.Jonathan is Mr.Peter teaching style. He always give student some tasks even some very hard to finish correctly, by doing that student to have to work all the time during Mr.Peter's class
