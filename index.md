### Description:


In the Monday class, Mr.Peter was the teacher who taught in my class. In the classroom, he gives students a lot of activities. After some short sections of teaching on how to paraphase, he began giving students the first activity to practice paraphase sentences. After the first activity, he began asking students to segment a larger and longer passage. These activities are mainly focused on helping students avoid plagiarism in the next exercises, especially the study group. During the lesson, I also learned that there are many types of citations and references. The idea that I've been following ever since is the Harvard RMIT style, which is the easiest style and we've gotten used to it.


### Feeling:

Although I am used to Peter's teaching style because I have studied with him since the previous course, the way he speaks and the activities he gives me really help me to understand the lesson, I prefer the way of Mr.Jonathan teaches than Mr.Peter because Mr.Jonathan was able to give me relaxation during class. After every Mr'Peter lesson, me and my friends are always exhausted.

### Evaluation and analyze:


The biggest difference between Mr.Peter and Mr.Jonathan is Mr.Peter's teaching style. Mr.Peter often assigns students a number of tasks, even some of which are difficult to complete correctly, by doing so the student will have to work all the time during Mr.Peter's class. Mr.Peter's teaching style was really helpful in making the students understand the content of the lesson that day, he was also very strict with the students who weren't paying attention. Peter often stops and asks questions to get the students' attention and also to make sure everyone understands so he can move on to the next section.

### Action plan:

Although I passed the previous course, my ciataion and paraphase are still not perfect, some are even wrong. After this class, I noticed that one of my problems was segmenting a paragrahp which might need to do a lot of re-study in the future. To practice this, I will have to try to achieve my goal with the information described in the upcoming group study exercise.
